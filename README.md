# Solar Map

Solar Map is an interactive 3D visualization of the solar system built with Vue.js 3 and Three.js. This project aims to provide a detailed and accurate depiction of the planets in our solar system, utilizing high-quality textures sourced from SolarSystemScope.com. Users can explore the relative positions and motions of the planets, enhancing their understanding of celestial dynamics in an engaging way.

## Vue.js 3

Vue.js 3 is a progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces. In this project, Vue.js manages the reactive state and the lifecycle of the web components, ensuring a responsive and interactive experience. The Composition API is utilized extensively for better code organization and readability.

## Three.js

Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and Application Programming Interface (API) used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser. In Solar Map, Three.js is used to render the 3D solar system model, including the planets and their orbits. The library enables the realistic texturing and animation of the celestial bodies.
